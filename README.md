# hello-world

I'll be learning my way around Git through this repository. 
Expect a lot of nonsense and junk to pass through.

The more rubbish we collect here the better off we'll be.

I haven't done much of this before.
Though I have done some simple commits with Project Euler solutions in a different repository.
