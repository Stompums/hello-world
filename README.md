# hello-world

I'll be learning my way around Git through this repository. 
Expect a lot of nonsense and junk to pass through.

The more rubbish we collect here the better off we'll be.

I haven't done much of this before.
Though I have done some simple commits with Project Euler solutions in a different repository.
The actual sense of purpose with this repository will make a difference. 
[Project Euler](https://github.com/Stompums/ProjectEuler) is just a storage suite for my own **_solutions_**.

I'll continue to explore topics such as
1. Ordered Lists
2. Unordered Lists
  * Sub lists
  * Tables
  * Other markdown topics

Things I have to do | Things I have finished
------------------- | ----------------------
Literally everything | I don't know what that is
Why haven't I finished my project | Fuckfuckfuck


@Stompums , How do you feel about this README?
